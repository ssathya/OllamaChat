# Project Overview: Connecting Blazor to Ollama Server

## Introduction

**Project Name:**  Blazor-Ollama Connector  **Version:**  0 (Work in Progress)

The Blazor-Ollama Connector project aims to establish seamless communication between a Blazor application and an Ollama server running on a Raspberry Pi. While currently in its initial version, the project demonstrates the essential functionality required for this connection.

## Key Features

1.  **Ollama Server Integration**: The project facilitates communication with an Ollama server, allowing data exchange between the Blazor front end and the Ollama AI LLM server.
    
2.  **Basic Functionality**: Despite being in Version 0, the application successfully fulfills the primary need of connecting the two systems. Users can send and receive data via the Ollama server.
    

## Areas for Improvement

1.  **Feature Enhancements**: As acknowledged, Version 0 lacks several critical features. These include proper logging, error handling, and robust security measures. Future iterations will address these gaps.
    
2.  **User Experience**: The current user interface is minimalistic. Enhancements in design and usability are planned for subsequent versions.
    

## Roadmap

1.  **Version 1**: Prioritize logging and error reporting. Implement secure communication protocols between Blazor and Ollama.
    
2.  **Version 2**: Enhance user experience with improved UI components. Consider additional features based on user feedback.
    

## Conclusion

While Blazor-Ollama Connector is a work in progress, it serves as a promising foundation for connecting Blazor applications to Ollama servers. Stay tuned for updates as we iterate and enhance this project!
